# DEPI-Hospital-Network-Design-G5

The Hospital Network Design and Implementation Project aims to create a comprehensive and secure network infrastructure for a hospital. This network will support the hospitalâ€™s clinical, administrative, and operational needs, ensuring that all departments can communicate effectively, access critical patient data securely, and maintain continuous operation. The project will utilise Cisco technologies, following the best practices, to design, implement, and optimise the network.
